# MSFS-KC-135
The open-source repository for the Delta Simulations KC-135R, E-6B, and RC-135W.

_**This is a development testbed and as such features incomplete models, avionics, and systems.**_
**BY DOWNLOADING THIS PACKAGE YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS AIRCRAFT IS INCOMPLETE AND NOT IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THESE AIRCRAFT WILL HAVE FLAWS, WHICH MAY NOT BE RESOLVED IN THE FUTURE.**

Due to its unfinished nature, we have only made the development source project available for download. If you wish to use the aircraft you must first build the SDK project in the sim. This is again made to ensure that users understand the stage this project is in. This is not supposed to be and was never supposed to be a fully-fledged project by our team. It is not representative of our usual projects.
