# MSFS-KC-135
The open-source repository for the Delta Simulations KC-135R, E6B, and RC-135W.
_**This is a development testbed, and as such features incomplete models, avionics, and systems.**_
Due to its unfinished nature, we have only made the development source project available for download. If you wish to use the aircraft you must first build the SDK project in the sim.
